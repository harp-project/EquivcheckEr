# EquivcheckEr

- Uses property based testing to check the equivalence of code refactored by Wrangler
- Compares folders or commits of the same codebase with the original and refactored code (git)

## Dependencies

- [Wrangler](https://refactoringtools.github.io/docs/wrangler/)
- [PropEr](https://proper-testing.github.io/)
- Jsone
- Git: The git cli client has to be installed
- Dialyzer, Typer (usually packaged together with Erlang)

## Installing

Just grab the latest [release](https://github.com/harp-project/EquivcheckEr/releases/latest) and put it somewhere on your `$PATH` (e.g.: `~/.local/bin`).
You also have to add execute permissions. (`chmod +x equivchecker`)

## Usage

To run the check, you can specify which folders or commits you want to compare like this

`$ equivchecker <original_source> <refactored_source>`

`$ equivchecker -c <original_commit> <refactored_commit>`

The `-c (or --commit)` flag tells equivchecker to use commits instead of folders.

You can also specify a single commit or folder, in which case the content of the current directory will be compared to it:

`$ equivchecker <original_folder>`

`$ equivchecker -c <original_commit>`

You can even omit both arguments:

`$ equivchecker`

In this case, the current directory will be compared to the currently checked out commit (HEAD).

### JSON

It's possible to get the output formatted as JSON:

`$ equivchecker --json`

### Statistics

Statistical information about the tests can be generated with `-s` or `--statistics`:

`$ equivchecker --statistics`
